# ASUS Radeon RX 580 8GB Dual-fan configuration file for amdgpu fancontol service

# ASUS Radeon RX 580 8GB Dual-fan starts to throttle (i.e. limit power
# consumption below maximum 145W) at 89 degrees. Thus turn fan to maximum 5
# degrees below that. Reducing the temperature using higher fan speeds below 89
# degrees does not seem to have any impact. PWM values below 62 make the fans
# stop, use 70 to account for aging. In desktop usage (Gnome 3.30) fans have to
# spin up regularly even when we only turn them on at temperatures above 70degC,
# therefore always leave them on (at 70 they are unhearable anyway) which is
# likely better for lifetime than constant start/stops.
#
# How does Windows 10 manage to keep the fans at 0rmp and the GPU below 50deg?
TEMPS=( 10000 70000 84000)

# PWM values corresponding to the defined temperatures.
# 0 will turn the fans off.
# 255 will let them spin at maximum speed.
# Default: ( 0 153 255 )

PWMS=( 70 70 255 )
